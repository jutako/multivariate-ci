# multivariate-ci - multivariate confidence intervals for R

This repository contains R code to produce some of the figures in manuscript:

"Multivariate confidence intervals": Korpela J., Oikarinen E., PuolamÃ¤ki K. and Ukkonen A., 2017, Proceedings of the 2017 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2017)

An extended version of the manuscript can be found in arXiv.org:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05763

# Howto
To quickly see how to compute confidence bands see `howto.R`. It also shows which files should be `source()`:d for things to work.

To reproduce the figures in the sDM2017 paper use:
> source("run.R")

with the root of this repository as your working directory.

If some packages are missing, you can install them using:
> install.packages(c('grid','ggplot2','zoo','signal','RColorBrewer'))
